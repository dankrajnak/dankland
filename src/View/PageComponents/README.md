# Page Components
These components are really just for use in one particular spot in the application. They're split out from the pages directory for now, but once I get the hang of gatsby's API, I'm going to move them in next the the components they're for.  Until now, though, they're organized like this:

```
|-PageComponents
  |- Page Name
    - ComponentOne
    - ComponentTwo
```
