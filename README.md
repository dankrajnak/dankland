# Dank Land

This is my personal website. The idea is that it
will be a place for me to put the web projects I've created that I think are interesting and worth showing. It's
also a bit of an experiment in itself as I try out new technologies I think are neat.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dankrajnak/dankland
